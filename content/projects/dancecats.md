What is DanceCats?
------------------
DanceCats is an open source tool used to generate Data reports using
web interface. It's written in Python and we are working hard to
upgrade it to new version.

Why DanceCats?
--------------
It's fast and suitable for making small reports, without using other
complexity tools.

Current Version
---------------
Please read our [user manual](http://dancecat.meonhun.com/manual.html).

What is next?
-------------
We are working on upgrading it to support more features:

- Support bigger data sets
- Better permission control
- Support ETL and data pipeline
- Support plug-in to support more data source types and more options
to do with the results
