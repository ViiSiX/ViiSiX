You do want to learn (more) about Python? 

Since I have also been learning this programming languages and have found its 
awesomeness so I decided to write this post and hoped that you will find a 
little bit help by using this.

And since you are learning, then I suggest that you should go with Python 3. 
Python 3 maybe lacks of library support but things have been changed, the only 
problem that you should consider is the compatibility of your application with 
the existing systems which are using Python 2 by default, but that is not a 
very big problem nowadays.

I will update this list frequently. There is also my recommendation 
libraries/frameworks at the end, please also have a look at that section and
give me your feedback :grin:.

## Learning materials

#### 1. E-learning courses

- MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python]
  (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)

#### 2. Guides

- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest):
  The site contains almost every things that you want to know about Python  
  from setup working environment to options for libraries/frameworks.
- [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com):
  More advantage topics and also best practice for Python.
- [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python):
  A awesome list for Python's solutions, libraries and frameworks.

#### 3. Books

Below books are free for you to read in your browser, very good ones :smile:.

- [Python for Informatics: Exploring Information]
  (http://www.pythonlearn.com/html-270) by Charles Severance
- [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapters) by Al Sweigart

### Programming objectives

When studying programming languages, practicing make you learn faster. But if 
you somehow are bored with text books and its examples, you should find 
something for achievements, those site below will help you. Further more,
you can learn more about algorithm just by practicing, have fun programming!

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net): The project's main aim is to help 
  learners solve problems with the combination of math, computer and programming.
- [Exercism](http://exercism.io): The name tell it all, you level up whenever
  you practice with those exercises.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com): Complete the tutorial, solve 
  problems, receive points, get the chances for jobs. Try this site.

### Recommendation for readings/libraries/frameworks:

- [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code]
  (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008): This is the coding convention for
  Python, together with PEP [257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) 
  (for docstring), you need to follow these 
  convention for better code reading and maintenance.
- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org): This is the tool to check your Python code, 
  and rate it. Using this you can keep your code clean and follow the best 
  practices.
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) and [PyUnit]
  (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyUnit): these are testing frameworks for 
  Python. Testing keep your code works right and also prevent faults coming 
  from modifying your code.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org): A web microframework for Python.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org): A web application can be used to
  create and share document having live code and also interacting, data 
  visualization. You can use it with other programing languages like R, 
  Julia...
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) and 
  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org): libraries used for mathematics, science,
  engineering and further more, data analysis. If you want to work with 
  machine learning, please also have a look at [scikit-learn]
  (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). 
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org): a toolkit for Natural Language Processing.
